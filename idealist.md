### Think of a name

## Basic idea
Giant clock and GITHUB CONTRIBUTE status under it, beside -> some Todo or whatever, and on the right, last tabs opened, and under it Maybe the time I spent on entertainment <> work

## To-do list

- [x] Use Javascript Date time to fetch date and time and display
  
- [ ] same to check every day‚Äôs commit (done or not), and checkmark the CONTRIBUTED sec,
- [ ] Maybe add 7 squares for green and grey, under it to show history
 
- [ ] Customisable Clock Faces (its background so just make a template maybe)

- [ ] Check if we can use Backend Locally without actually booting it up

- [ ] Check previous browser history and Recent closed and have a tab to restore them

- [ ] We CANNNNN add a plugin where we ‚ÄúMARK‚Äù a tab as view later and add it to the list, SINGLE CLICK to view and DOUBLE CLICK to remove

- [ ] ACCESSIBLITY idea, We can link our JSON or whatever to some online storage like GitHub or something and access it from all devices, BUTTTTT we need to upload data tooo, soo Access issues need to be addressed

## Elaborated idea

*A Giant clock with a Daily reminder to `Contribute to Github`, `solve a Problem in CP`, go out, brush your teeth, etc ( humor üíØ )
Tho it should also further contain EVERYDAY and PERMANET todos, all in 1 place, and Hopefully in the future I can add the option to view time ratio of entertainment to work (tho that seem tough), it‚Äôs a simple yet ambitious project and I feel I should do it üòÄ*
